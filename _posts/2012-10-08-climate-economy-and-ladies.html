As a postscript to the previous entry, here's a quick story about a newspaper&nbsp;interview&nbsp;that I had last week.&nbsp;It was with one of the major broadsheets of the region and related to the launch of <a href="http://www.reconhub.com/" target="_blank">our new website</a>.<br /><br />The interview itself went pretty well, I thought. The journalist was mostly interested in discussing our aims, as well as how we perceive the public's general understanding of environmental issues from an economic perspective.<br /><br />At one point, he asked the inevitable question of how I ended up in Scandinavia all the way from Cape Town. I told him that it was mostly down to my interests in these very issues. You'd be hard pressed to find a country that has a better track record of managing its natural resources than Norway.&nbsp;It didn't hurt that I was also lucky enough to receive some generous funding offers.[*]<br /><br />However, I went on to tell him a joke that I had heard from another Southern Hemisphere expat upon arrival, which is that people like us usually find ourselves in Norway for one of two reasons: Oil or women. It was a throwaway line of course (and quite obviously a jape), and I didn't think much more of it...<br /><br />I suppose it reflects my media&nbsp;naivete then that I was surprised[**] by the headline that ran above my interview the next day: "<i>Climate, economy and ladies</i>".<br />___<br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">[*] E.g. For those of you thinking about doing a PhD &mdash; but can't bear the thought of scraping by on a measly tuition stipend for four/five years &mdash; consider this: Doing a PhD in Norway is treated as a job and you are paid accordingly. That is, your salary has to be somewhat comparable with what a Master's graduate could typically earn outside of academia. Accepted PhD candidates are thus awarded a "research scholarship" which <a href="http://www.nhh.no/default.aspx?ID=418" target="_blank">currently amounts</a> to around US$71,000 per annum...</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">[**] Mind you, probably not as surprised as my (non-Norwegian) girlfriend.</span>
