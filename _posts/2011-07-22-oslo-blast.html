Man oh man...<br /><br />Apart from the immediate concerns for the injured and dead, I dread some of the&nbsp;reverberations from the bomb attack in Oslo. Thankfully, it appears that my many friends in in the city are all okay. Some personal relief amidst the broader social tragedy.<br /><br />It's obviously very early days and no precise suspect(s) at the moment &mdash; even though the signs over the last year point towards some Islamic extremist group.&nbsp;I hope that these actions by the few don't lead to heightened&nbsp;xenophobia and&nbsp;fewer civil liberties for the many.&nbsp;However, I fear the big loser over the coming months (and possibly years) will be social&nbsp;integration and&nbsp;immigration reform.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE</b>: Wow. I wrote this before knowing about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14259356">senseless massacre&nbsp;on Ut√∏ya island</a>. The &nbsp;tragedy has now been magnified in infamous scale and the main&nbsp;presupposition turned on its heads. It now appears that a lone (ethnic) Norwegian madman was acting on an unfathomable and incendiary hatred. The bomb blast in Oslo now seems to me to have been a terrible diversion of sorts; it does seem to have been timed to minimise the loss of human life... Before the targeted bloodbath that followed.<br /><br />Hard to know what to say in times like these, but my thoughts go out to the country and especially all those that have lost loved ones.
