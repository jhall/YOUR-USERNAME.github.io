<div class="tr_bq">about their water footprint.</div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lJnlgM1yEU0" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />Like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-09-23-first-journal-submission %}" target="_blank">thermal-based power plants</a>, data centers are thirsty bastards when it comes to cooling water. The above video comes via <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/toddwoody/2012/03/15/google-greens-up-data-center-with-recycled-water-for-cooling/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, who also inform us:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>Google did not reveal exactly how much water the Douglas County data center consumes but in an e-mail company spokeswoman Kate Hurowitz said, “It varies from day to day, but a typical data center of this size can use hundreds of thousands of gallons a day.”&nbsp;</span></blockquote>I can barely say Chattahoochee River, let alone spell it, but they look like good, salt o' the earth folk to me. I'm happy if they're happy.<br /><blockquote><span>Peter Frost, executive director of the Douglasville-Douglas County Water and Sewer Authority, said Google is saving taxpayer money as the local government now does not have to treat as much wastewater.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>“That saves capacity for future homeowners as well as businesses,” he said in the video.</span> <i>[Thanks Pete, we saw the video! - Ed.]</i></blockquote>
