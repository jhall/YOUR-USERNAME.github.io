As a general rule, bottled water is not particularly good for the environment. If I were the&nbsp;judgmental type, I might even chime in that buying bottled water is pretty dumb &mdash; at least in the circles that I move in &mdash; given that it is typically of no better quality than tap water. But each to their own.[*]<br /><br />Regardless, this is very cool:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="560" height="315" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-767e3e58d8cbe25a" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D767e3e58d8cbe25a%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1462474294%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D9D6EB382E20A402D36011E8F46DA88A3D269173A.2E2C62C5D888583BC491B77CBED2E3A9A724456B%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D767e3e58d8cbe25a%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DuPd5nQBNETHFyHgZlpZohfSnEBk&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D767e3e58d8cbe25a%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1462474294%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D9D6EB382E20A402D36011E8F46DA88A3D269173A.2E2C62C5D888583BC491B77CBED2E3A9A724456B%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D767e3e58d8cbe25a%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DuPd5nQBNETHFyHgZlpZohfSnEBk&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div>(via <a href="http://wimp.com/lightenup/">WIMP</a>)<br /><br /><b>UPDATE:</b> The GF points out that I perhaps shouldn't emphasise the bottled <i>water </i>angle so much, since any beverage bottle would do (fizzy drinks, etc).<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] Okay, I'm being a bit facetious here. I actually agree with <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2010/06/water-chat-with-tom-lauria.html">David Zetland</a> that bottled water is probably best viewed as a consumer product much like any other.</span>
