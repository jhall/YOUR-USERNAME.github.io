Coming at ya live outta southern Denmark[*], a (very) quick Cover Thurdays edition to keep you interested.<br /><br />Most of you probably know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Vernon">Justin Vernon</a> as the brains, voice and talent behind Bon Iver. If you didn't, well now you do.<br /><br />[Note: I was tempted to say "shame on you", but we're trying not be judgemental here at <i>The Corral</i>. However, I highly recommend that you remedy any unfamiliarity with today's subject ASAP. Seriously. Start <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbjuGeg8Xyk&amp;NR=1">here</a> and then head <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-BZ0D92mtU">here</a> to get idea of what we're dealing with. You can thank me later]<br /><br />Anyway, a couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://nicrosslee.posterous.com/">Nic R</a> showed me a very cool cover of Sade's "By Your Side" by Gayngs, which is another Justin Vernon project. However, since I've made it a habit of putting together a pair of songs for these CT posts, I've been waiting for the right companion piece before posting it...<br /><br />Now, thankfully, the wait is over. Earlier this week&nbsp;on the Jimmy Fallon Show, Justin delivered a quite sublime performance of the Bonnie Raitt classic, "I Can't Make You Love Me". With apologies to&nbsp;Jónzi Birgisson (Sigur Rós) and Matt Bellamy (Muse), you won't have been this moved by a falsetto, since the first time you watched <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>...<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PMhAvl0Hg-w" width="425"></iframe><br /><br /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="361" src="http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid1089.photobucket.com/albums/i359/dg11469/May%2023%202011%20-%20May%2029%202011/boniverfallon_Segment100-00-04-00-05-15.mp4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" wmode="transparent"></embed><br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] As mentioned previously, I'm here for an econometrics conference. I'm not expecting this to be barrel of laughs, but looking forward to some feedback on a paper I've been working on and will be presenting. More importantly though... </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.legoland.dk/en/">Legoland</a></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"> IS JUST DOWN THE ROAD! Yes, my friends, childhood dreams do come true...</span>
