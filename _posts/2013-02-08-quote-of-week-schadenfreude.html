<blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[T]he British are the only people who indulge in schadenfreude – pleasure derived from another’s misery – about themselves."</i></blockquote>An oldie, admittedly, but nicely recycled in <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/lse-manifesto-growth" target="_blank">this Vox EU article</a> by Tim Besley and John van Reenen.
