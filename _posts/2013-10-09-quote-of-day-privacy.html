<blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"At a moment of austerity and with a general sense that our state's ability to guarantee prosperity for its citizens is in retreat, that same state is about to make the biggest advance ever in its security powers. In public, the state is shrinking; in private, it is shrinking until it gets just small enough to fit into our phones, our computers, our cars, our fridges, our bedrooms, our thoughts and intentions."</i></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">- Taken from a long, but very worthwhile (and disconcerting) article by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/edward-snowden-files-john-lanchester" target="_blank">John Lanchester</a>.</div>
