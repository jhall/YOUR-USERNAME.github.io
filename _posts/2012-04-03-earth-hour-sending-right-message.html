In the build up to this year's <a href="http://www.earthday.org/" target="_blank">Earth Hour</a>, humourless critics were once again up in arms about the fact that turning off the lights for one hour would have a&nbsp;negligible&nbsp;effect&nbsp;on energy consumption.<br /><br />Yes, because symbolic acts should be seen as outright solutions, rather than <strike>symbolizing</strike> representing solidarity with some wider issue. You know, like Tommie Smith and John Carlos thought that the solution to racial discrimination would be for everyone to walk around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute" target="_blank">with an upraised fist</a>.<br /><br />Sounds to me like a lot of people could use a course in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_OezlTZ1A" target="_blank">symbology</a>.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lG_OezlTZ1A" width="420"></iframe><br /><br />That said, there are reasons to be critical of Earth Hour and, indeed, question the symbolic message that it <i>does </i>send. In that light, one of the better "contrarian" takes that I've read lately comes from <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/energy/an-hour-without-power-is-not-the-enlightened-answer" target="_blank">Robin Mills</a>, who argues that good intentions are undermined by a misguided signals:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>Of course, improved energy efficiency is vital. The confusion is between conservation &mdash; doing less &mdash; and efficiency &mdash; doing more with less.</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>[snip]</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Environmentalism should not be about less &mdash; it is about more: energy that is more abundant, cleaner, cheaper, more secure; economies that grow faster with new technologies; more people escaping poverty.</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Darkness spreading across the planet should not be the aim of environmental campaigns &mdash; it should be a symbol of what happens when energy and environmental policy fails.</span></blockquote>Environmental organisations like the WWF (or any advocacy group <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-03-11-real-reason-to-be-wary-of-kony-2012 %}" target="_blank">for that matter</a>) need to think hard about the broader associations that come with their campaign messages. Concern about the planet's well-being is clearly&nbsp;laudable, but they will lose this fight if their cause becomes associated with privation.
