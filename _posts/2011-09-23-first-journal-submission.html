In other news...<br /><br />I finally submitted my (co-authored) paper to a journal yesterday.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span">Title:&nbsp;</span></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Electricity Prices, River Temperatures and Cooling Water Scarcity</span></div><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span">Abstract:&nbsp;</span></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 24px;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%;">Thermal-based power stations rely on water for cooling purposes. These water sources may be subject to incidents of scarcity, environmental regulations and competing economic concerns. This paper analyses the impacts of water scarcity and increased river temperatures on German electricity prices&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 150%;">from 2002 to 2009</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="line-height: 150%;">. Having controlled for demand effects, the results indicate that the electricity price is significantly impacted by both a change in river temperatures and the relative abundance of river water. An implication is that future&nbsp;climate change&nbsp;will affect&nbsp;electricity prices not only&nbsp;through changes in demand, but also&nbsp;via increased water temperatures and scarcity.</span></span></span></div><br />All told, I'm pretty happy with it. We'll see what the reviewers think, though... As I understand it, these things take their time and I'm only expecting hear back at the start of next year. Still, a big relief to get it out the door.
