Commentator Dave asks a question on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-04-28-cover-thursdays-tv-on-radio-edition %}">this post</a>;&nbsp;what album would I consider worthy of the title "2008 Album of the Year"? (See the post for date context.)<br /><div><br /></div><div>I didn't even bat an eyelid in answering: "Frightened Rabbit's <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Organ_Fight">Midnight Organ Fight</a></i> by a country mile".&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>By coincidence then, I see that my mate <a href="http://nicrosslee.posterous.com/">Nic</a> has just posted a song off their (equally-as-good) 2010 follow up, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter_of_Mixed_Drinks">The Winter of Mixed Drinks</a></i>, on Facebook. Being the perceptive reader of signs that I am, I do not wish to anger the blogging gods by refusing a post on, arguably, the best thing to emerge from the music world over the last five years.</div><div><br /></div><div>Since this post is largely directed at those among you that <i>don't </i>know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frightened_Rabbit">Frightened Rabbit</a> already... I can only repeat a comment that I saw the first time I ever watched one of their videos. And I quote: "<i>Go out and buy their album now. It will change your life for the better with its infinite awesomeness.</i>"</div><div><br /></div><div>Pretty profound piece of folk wisdom there[*] and, what's more, not one word of lie! Seriously, go out and get your hands on their stuff. I'll start you off with this, which is where I began:<br /><br /></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-qZr1uHiwsY" width="425"></iframe></div><div><i>[Please note some NSFW lyrics. Although, what's few cuss words between friends?]</i><br /><br /></div><div>Now try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVuur7aTX8w">Poke</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxCaqJdV4E8">Heads Roll Off</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzjERZU3wbY&amp;feature=related">Swim Until You Can't See Land</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbp28QvMKn8">Fast Blood</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO1IdkH6p8">The Wrestle</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Lf7mriehU">The Loneliness &amp; The Scream</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NjTVkCnFO8">Not Miserable</a>,...</div><div><br /></div><div>Actually, just buy the albums. Trust me, they will improve your life with their infinite awesomeness.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] The best music endorsement that I've yet heard was spoilt for the fact that it was describing a Bj√∂rk concert; an artist that I simply cannot stand. Asked how the experience was, the reply came: "</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue; font-size: x-small;">Like losing your virginity to God</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">". Such a good chirp and more's the pity that it was wasted on that little Icelandic oddity!</span></div>
