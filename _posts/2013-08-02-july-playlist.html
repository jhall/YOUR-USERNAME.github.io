My fellow <a href="http://noondaytune.com/">Noondaytune.com</a>&nbsp;contributors have outdone themselves with some very cool song choices during the month of July. I say this with some authority as it was my turn to go through them and select eight favourite tracks for an end-of-the-month playlist. Here it is!<br /><br /><iframe height="250" src="http://8tracks.com/mixes/2151813/player_v3_universal" style="border: 0px none;" width="300"></iframe> <br /><div class="_8t_embed_p" style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 12px;"><a href="http://8tracks.com/noonday-tune/noonday-tune-volume-2-twelve">Noonday Tune - Volume 2: Twelve</a> from <a href="http://8tracks.com/noonday-tune">Noonday Tune</a> on <a href="http://8tracks.com/">8tracks Radio</a>.</div><br /><br />(In addition to the opening track of the above playlist, my own recent contributions include <a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/55950510552/into-my-arms-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds-the" target="_blank">Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds</a> and <a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/57146457189/jive-babe-mikhael-paskalev-mikhael-paskalev-is" target="_blank">Mikhael Paskalev</a>.)
