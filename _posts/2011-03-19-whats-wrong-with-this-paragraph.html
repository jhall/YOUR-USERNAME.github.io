From <i><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18398734?story_id=18398734&amp;fsrc=rss">The Economist</a></i>:<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">Of the nuclear plants that provide about a third of Japan’s electricity (see chart), Fukushima Dai-ichi is not the first to be paralysed by an earthquake. But it is the first to be laid low by the technology’s dependence on a ready supply of water for cooling<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">.</span></span></blockquote>Well, of course, you have already read <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-03-17-nuclear-and-water %}">this</a> post so you know.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE:</b> Okay, I'm probably too quick on the draw here. Nuclear reactors and water issues isolated to Japan? Fine. (Although the thrust of the article is certainly to contextualise the role and&nbsp;vulnerabilities&nbsp;of nuclear power on a global scale. In that context, I maintain that including the above sentence without reference to the water-related problems experienced by nuclear plants in Europe the US, is misleading.)
