When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Morrison_(singer)" target="_blank">James&nbsp;Morrison</a>&nbsp;first came on to the scene, I was distinctly of the "meh" opinion. His debut album <i>Undiscovered </i>was everywhere I looked and, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why. On the mediocre side of average IMHO.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Bear in mind that a) I was living in London at the time, and b) the Brits have a singular ability to foster contempt&nbsp;among non-Brits&nbsp;for local artists and sportsmen as a result of their incessant patriotic promotion.[*]<br /><br />That's not to say that this was bad period for me on the musical front. The music scene in London is pretty amazing and I was left almost frantic with the notion that I could see a superb live act every other night. (Coming from South Africa, this was like being on another planet...) The general Brit "sound" around that time was also pretty great, if I think back: The Fratellis, Editors, Bloc Party, Arctic Monkeys, Muse, Amy Winehouse, Kasabian, Kooks, Razorlight, etc etc</div><div><br /></div><div>But not James Morrison, whom seemed to be empty pop masquerading as thoughtful troubadour... and he hasn't done much to grow on me since. Having said that, while I don't normally like the music he makes, I do recognize&nbsp;that Morrison has a pretty unique voice with some real soulful quality to it.[**]&nbsp;In other words, he's exactly the type of candidate that <i>can </i>produce a good cover.<br /><br />I still have mixed feelings about including him here, among the &mdash; coveted! &mdash; ranks of <i>Cover Thursdays</i>&nbsp;alumni&nbsp;at Stickman's Corral. However, hopefully you'll enjoy these two tracks that I've selected for your listening pleasure this fine Thursday. Both are acoustic numbers that offer Morrison a platform to showcase his smokey pipes and perhaps win us naysayers over...<br /><br />1) "Man In The Mirror", originally by a certain Michael Jackson:</div><div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8XaTT68NCho" width="420"></iframe><br /><br />2) "<strike>Gangster's</strike> Gangsta's Paradise", originally by two-hit wonder, Coolio:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SqGYHl8Y8b4" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><br />Verdict?<br />Yes, no, maybe?<br /><br />---</div><div>[*]&nbsp;Tennis being an obvious "beneficiary" of this counterproductive approach. Poor ol' Tim Henman never stood a chance (even if he had been born with a personality). Andy Murray was pretty much goosed from the get go as well (even if he hadn't been born with a cactus lodged in his colon).<br /><br />[**]&nbsp;Full disclosure: I did quite enjoy his last single, "<i>I won't let you go</i>".&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8aaS5ezgdw" target="_blank">This acoustic version</a>&nbsp;is certainly impressive and, if the music doesn't grab you, then the facial expressions just might do it...</div>
