You may have noticed that things have been a bit slow around the<i>&nbsp;Corral</i> lately. Primary reason being that I have been involved in numerous applications and interviews; both academic and private sector.<br /><br />And so, after much consideration and classic Stickman-esque stalling...<br /><br />Looks like I'll be doing a PhD after all :)<br /><br />Yup, I'll be heading back to the Nordics in August to begin my doctorate in economics, where I am the grateful recipient of a very generous research scholarship.[*]&nbsp;My focus will remain on environmental and resource issues, although I am very much interested in development, as well as behavioural and institutional aspects of economics too. In that spirit,&nbsp;the overarching theme of my research proposal will be the <i>water-energy nexus</i> and I hope to build on the work&nbsp;that I've started during my Master's. (More on that at a later stage.)<br /><br />My (modest) belief is that this will become an increasingly important topic in the years to come and hopefully I can provide some relevant research to help address the issue. At the least, I'm hoping to get a little more respect than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVzvQMf3hIQ">this guy</a>.<br /><br />Stickman, out!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] For those of you interested in advanced studies, I strongly recommend investigating options in the Nordic/Scandinavian region. A PhD is considered as a legitimate job over here and, as with most forms of employment, you are very well compensated. Indeed, the irony is that I stand to earn more doing my doctorate in Norway than I almost certainly would expect from private sector work back in South Africa. Of course, you need to consider living costs and so forth, but even then it's a close-run thing on a relative scale. (Say nothing of long-term prospects after graduation... Well, that's what I'm telling myself at least! Still, much better than the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/a-life-of-debt-begins-here-will-students-money-worries-ever-end-2243851.html">suffocating burden</a> of student debt engulfing the UK and elsewhere.)</span>
