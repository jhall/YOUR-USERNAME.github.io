Paul Krugman is the ultimate polarising force. People either love<i> </i>him or loathe him. I suppose that's&nbsp;what&nbsp;comes with the territory when you are, arguably, the world's most high profile economist.<br /><br />Anyway, seeing as I referred to him in my previous posts on climate change and food prices, here are two links that seem kinda relevant.<br /><br />1) Roger Pielke Jr has a&nbsp;<a href="http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2011/02/krugman-loses-perspective.html">post</a> criticizing Paul Krugman's citiation of extreme weather events in which he questions any causation between long-run carbon levels and food prices.&nbsp;<a href="http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2011/02/krugman-loses-perspective.html?showComment=1297298317362#c2409740645246318641">I left a comment</a>&nbsp;saying, among other things, that I regard his invocation of the historical food record as tempting the gods of false equivalence. I also think that he's being uncharitable in his basic reading of Krugman's argument. Still, it's an interesting debate with thought-provoking points raised on both sides... I'd especially like to see whether more people pick up on my comments about Norman Borlaug and the possibilities of another "Green Revolution".<br /><br />2) Back to PK himself, who, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/gimme-an-a-gimme-an-e-gimme-an-r/">in commenting on the American Economic Review's "Top 20" papers of the last 100 years</a>, had this to say:<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">It’s also worth noting that a number of the papers on the list involve very simple, intuitive models — that includes Friedman on the natural rate, Krueger on rent-seeking, Mundell on currency areas; Shiller’s great piece on stock volatility was also a remarkably simple concept yielding a powerful insight. My own paper was actually pretty math-heavy; uncharacteristically, it’s also a paper in which <b>doing the math fundamentally changed my mind about things (I didn’t believe the home market effect was real until it popped out of the equations; only then did I realize it was obvious.)</b></span></blockquote>Hmmm. Sounds <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-10-02-why-we-need-maths-in-economics %}">kinda familiar</a>...<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">Further, and I would say more importantly, [maths] enables us to fully work through the consequences and dynamics of [economic] relationships. Our intuition may suggest certain outcomes, but intuition can be pretty limited in scope. Working through a set of equations enables you to arrive at a final result with a cool clarity, which may then show up unexpected results that only become “intuitive” upon further reflection.</span></blockquote>;)<br /><br />o-[-&lt;
