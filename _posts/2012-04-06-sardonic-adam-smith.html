<blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>In reality high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than high wages. [...]In raising the price of commodities the rise of wages operates in the same manner as simple interest does in the accumulation of debt. The rise of profit operates like compound interest. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains. They complain only of those of other people.</span></span></blockquote><div><div style="text-align: right;">-&nbsp;Wealth of Nations,&nbsp;Book 1, Chapter 9</div></div>
