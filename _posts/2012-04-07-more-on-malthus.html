If you don't wish to take my word on Malthus, here's a snippet from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Malthus.html" target="_blank">Econlib's excellent&nbsp;encyclopedia entry</a>&nbsp;that I've just stumbled upon:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Malthus is arguably the most misunderstood and misrepresented economist of all time.</span> The adjective “Malthusian” is used today to describe a pessimistic prediction of the lock-step demise of a humanity doomed to starvation via overpopulation. When his hypothesis was first stated in his best-selling <i>An Essay on the Principle of Population</i> (1798), the uproar it caused among noneconomists overshadowed the instant respect it inspired among his fellow economists. So irrefutable and simple was his illustrative side-by-side comparison of an arithmetic and a geometric series — food increases more slowly than population — that it was often taken out of context and highlighted as his main observation. The observation is, indeed, so stark that <span style="background-color: yellow;">it is still easy to lose sight of Malthus’s actual conclusion: that because humans have not all starved, economic choices must be at work, and it is the job of an economist to study those choices.</span></span></blockquote>Need I remind you, Econlib is a libertarian initiative, so it's not like this is grandstanding from some left-leaning environmental institute.
