After my previous Norway bump, here are two videos that seem appropriate.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wtaq6AT9EVA" width="560"></iframe> <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3db3-Y2zyps" width="560"></iframe> <br /><br />Both are taken from a new documentary by the Norwegian national broadcaster, NRK, that showcases some of the country's breathtaking scenery. From the <a href="http://nrkbeta.no/2013/01/15/nordlandsbanen-minute-by-minute-season-by-season/" target="_blank">NRK website</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>The Nordland Railway (‘Nordlandsbanen’ in Norwegian) celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. The railway is 729 kilometers long, and passes [through] spectacular scenery, varying from the fjord area around Trondheim in the south, through beautiful valleys, over mountains and along fjords before crossing the Arctic Circle at Saltfjellet and descending down to the coastal city of Bodø.</span></blockquote>PS - The band from the first video, <i>Fleur de Lis</i>, could be characterised as a heavier version of <i>Sigur Rós</i> and are well worth <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_jGC423WU0" target="_blank">checking out</a>.
