In search for a unifying theme for this week's <i>Cover&nbsp;Thursdays</i> post, I suppose that I can do no better than tip my hat to the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Options for Kiwi bands are fairly limited &mdash; let alone covers decent thereof &mdash; but I think that I've got two songs here that you will enjoy...<br /><br />First up, a very nice find by <a href="http://primalbeer.wordpress.com/">The Primate</a> (keep up the good work, meneer). <i>Boy &amp; Bear</i> get kinda bluegrassy on <i>Crowded House's</i> "Fall at Your Feet":<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wJwjKL2dxXo" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />Next,&nbsp;<i>The Naked &amp; Famous</i>&nbsp;see their synth-drenched "Punching In A Dream" given the ol' acoustic guitar and xylophone treatment by&nbsp;Antipodean&nbsp;fellows <i>The Mission In Motion</i>:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/K2l3tbdMcFE" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />PS - If you are confused by the subject line of this post, then I suggest heading <a href="http://www.travelcentre.com.au/travel/australiaNewzealand/new_zealand/how_to_speak_new_zealand.htm">here</a> for a little exercise in the Kiwi vernacular.
