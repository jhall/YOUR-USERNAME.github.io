<div style="text-align: justify;">The taxi arrives in three and a half hours to be precise... And it's just gone midnight now, so you can guess how I'm going to be feeling after the 16-odd hours travelling time. Still, really looking forward to getting to SA and seeing everyone.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I plan to write some musings on my experiences here once I get settled in at home and soak up some southern hemisphere sun (and reasonably priced drinks). While that will have to wait, here's something I rather enjoyed from my time here in the Nordics. Great vocalist and really enjoy this live version...</div><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/KirfeA0JzbA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/KirfeA0JzbA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><div><br />See you soon.<br />o-[-&lt;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>UPDATE: Getting home turned out to be an absolute disaster. Flights cancelled and then rerouted. End result: Total travel time increased to 36 hours via four cities. To top it all off, our luggage was lost. Managed to get it back a few days later, but hardly the ideal start!</div>
