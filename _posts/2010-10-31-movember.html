<div style="text-align: justify;">Anyone out there doing <a href="http://www.movember.com/">Movember</a>?</div><div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Movember (the month formerly known as November) is a month long moustache growing charity event held each year to help raise funds and awareness for menâ€™s health.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Having started in Australia seven years ago, Movember has grown to be an international event, taking place in six countries. This global expansion looks set to continue with demand from Mo Bros and Sistas around the world wanting to grow moustaches and celebrate Movember in their own countries.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Movember is about bringing back the moustache for a serious cause and sees Mo Bros, supported by the Mo Sistas in their life, register at Movember.com and then start Movember 1st with a clean-shaven face. They have the remainder of the month to grow and groom their moustache, whilst raising funds and awareness. Each Movember we challenge men to change their appearance and the face of men's health by growing a moustache. <b>The moustache is our ribbon, the means by which we raise awareness and funds for prostate cancer and depression in men programs</b>.</span></blockquote></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_s00UYWAZMqA/TM2WEpYS5PI/AAAAAAAAAFc/mEoXBtbpQlc/s1600/Movember+Logo.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="66" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_s00UYWAZMqA/TM2WEpYS5PI/AAAAAAAAAFc/mEoXBtbpQlc/s200/Movember+Logo.JPG" width="200" /></a></div><br />Having grown a "mo" for the last few years, I have to admit that I'm not sure whether I'll be partaking in full this year. Apart from the fun of doing it with friends, there's safety in numbers for these things... which made it much easier to do when I was living in London and Cape Town. (While many Commonwealth countries have embraced the MOvement (zing!), Movember has yet to take off in the Nordics so I was pretty much all on my own last year.)*&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">:'(</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Still, it's a great cause and I'll see whether I can persuade some of my European fellows to embrace a return to looking like real men...</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">* Despite the lack of support, I will say that I still put out quite a beauty last year.
