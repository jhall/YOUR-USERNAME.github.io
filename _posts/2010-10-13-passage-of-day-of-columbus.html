<div style="text-align: justify;">So I'm a few days late, but Monday was Columbus Day for our friends over States' side. I know this because <a href="http://aguanomics.com/2010/10/columbus-day.html">Aguanomics</a> mentioned it at the time, offering the following aphorism:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The Europeans brought technology and used resources for population growth. The locals would have preferred to use the technology for themselves, but they didn't have the guns.</span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, the above reminded me of a great passage I read a while ago in David Landes' <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i>:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The scarcity of gold was a disappointment, but [Columbus] made the best of things and assured that these islands could be an abundant source of slaves[...] Caribbean history after the coming of the white man was in large part the replacement of people by cattle, followed by a repeopling with black slaves to work the sugar plantations.</span>&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The process of depopulation was hastened by massacre, barbarous cruelty, deep despair. The natives committed suicide , abstained from sex, aborted their fetuses, killed their babies. They also fell by the tens and hundreds and thousands to Old World pathogens (smallpox, influenza). <b>The Spanish debated whether the savages they encountered had a soul and were human; but the record makes clear where the savagery lay. When Columbus met his first Indians, he could not get over their friendliness; to this the Spaniards, frustrated for gold, returned bestialities unworthy of beasts</b>. (p. 71)</span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">You can read the whole chapter <a href="http://irm.bc.edu/reserves/mh100/sull/mh10028.pdf">here</a>. (The most graphic bit actually follows directly from the quoted section. Among other acts of savagery, there is a particularly gruesome sentence involving the treatment of pregnant women...)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On the subject of brutal Spanish incursions into the Americas, it would be rude not to include the following Neil Young classic:</div><br /><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aPL9MQHfIx8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/aPL9MQHfIx8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Young does, of course, rather play down the violence that was endemic in some parts of South America prior to the Europeans arriving. Landes actually has a very good line on this issue in a later chapter when discussing a question posed by another eminent scholar, Jared Diamond: Why did the Incas behave so naively (stupidly?) in their dealings with the Spanish, when the latter were so consistently treacherous? Diamond suggested that it was a matter of innocence: The Spanish were well versed in the devious history of man and empires, while the Incas had <span class="Apple-style-span">"no personal experience of any other invaders from overseas... had not even heard (or read) of similar threats to anyone else, anywhere else, anytime previously in history"</span>. However, having listed some of the stark cruelties which had characterised the pre-European Inca Empire, Landes reasonably counters: <span class="Apple-style-span">"But the Incas should have known themselves."</span> (p. 108)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">PS - If you're into covers... well, I am. The Dave Matthews Band and Warren Hayes do a very respectable version of "Cortez the Killer" live in Central Park <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00WWmtWh-Mk">here</a>.</div>
