It might be difficult to keep track of things in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-05-13-nope-nordhaus-is-still-mostly-right %}" target="_blank">previous post</a>, because the lengthy discussion involves numerous claims and counterclaims. With the aim in simplifying things, here is a comment that I left on <a href="http://factsandotherstubbornthings.blogspot.com/2012/05/assault-of-thoughts-5132012.html?showComment=1336953707558#c6625370172164190422" target="_blank">Daniel Kuehn's blog</a>. I think that it provides a decent summary of my views:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span id="bc_0_4b+seedN7C_D" kind="d">Regarding "<i>dancing around the issues</i>"...  Bob, my point here is that by choosing to interpret the WSJ skeptics  (and Nordhaus' response) the way you do, you are either: a) Ignoring the  obvious implications that they intended for their readers, or b)  Rendering their specific claims as trivialities. <br /><br />E.g. If you  seriously believe that the skeptic claim about temperatures this decade  &mdash; i.e. "they have been flat" &mdash; was not meant to convey any deeper  message about future climate trends, do you then think that this  observation is of any real use in of itself? Of course, if you think  that it <i>does</i> say something important about long-term climate  trends, which is the only thing that really matters in this debate, then  you are back to the Nordhaus' response.<br /><br />The Tol article is  separate to the above and I do think that you highlight an important  point regarding the net benefits associated with modest warming. Not  many people understand this and you claim that Nordhaus badly misleads  his readers by saying "Richard Tol finds a wide range of damages,  particularly if warming is greater than 2 degrees"... despite the fact  that Tol's own graph clearly shows net benefits up until that point. <i><span style="color: black;">[See <a href="http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Nordhaus2.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> - Ed.]</span></i><br /><br />My  response is that Tol specifically deals with this issue in his paper.  He points out that these are "sunk" benefits, which we stand to accrue  regardless of our policy choices today. The inertia in our climatic and  economic systems will already ensure that we reach the edge of these  positive gains from warming (due to increased agricultural yields, etc).  Any action that we take against CO2 emissions today are solely aimed at  tackling temperatures above two degrees, i.e. where things start  heading into serious negative territory. <br /><br />Bob, may I ask you whether you think your IER article helped readers understand <i>this</i> crucial point?</span></blockquote>
