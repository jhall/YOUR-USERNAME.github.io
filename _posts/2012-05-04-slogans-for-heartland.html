Given my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-03-26-bob-murphy-on-heartland-and-gleick %}" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-03-30-casting-additional-doubt-on-bobs %}" target="_blank">discussion</a> of the Heartland Institute and climate change, I feel to compelled to comment on this latest development. From <i><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/may/04/heartland-institute-global-warming-murder?CMP=twt_gu" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></i>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span><b>Heartland Institute compares belief in global warming to mass murder&nbsp;</b></span><br /><br /><span><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/5/4/1336125117472/Leo-blog--The-Heartland-I-007.jpg" /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Billboards in Chicago paid for by The Heartland Institute along the inbound Eisenhower Expressway in Maywood, Illinois. Photograph: The Heartland Institute</span><br /><br />It really is hard to know where to begin with this one. But let's start with: "What on earth were they thinking?"&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The <a href="http://heartland.org/"><span>Heartland Institute</span></a>, a Chicago-based rightwing thinktank <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/jul/19/climate-change-wiki-heartland-institute">notorious for promoting climate scepticism</a>, has launched quite possibly one of the most ill-judged poster campaigns in the history of ill-judged poster campaigns.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I'll let its <a href="http://climateconference.heartland.org/our-billboards/"><span>own press release</span></a> for its upcoming conference explain, as there's simply no need to finesse it further:</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #3d85c6;">Billboards in Chicago paid for by The Heartland Institute point out that some of the world's most notorious criminals say they "still believe in global warming" – and ask viewers if they do, too…The billboard series features Ted Kaczynski, the infamous Unabomber; Charles Manson, a mass murderer; and Fidel Castro, a tyrant. Other global warming alarmists who may appear on future billboards include Osama bin Laden and James J. Lee (who took hostages inside the headquarters of the Discovery Channel in 2010).&nbsp;</span></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #3d85c6;">[snip]&nbsp;</span></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #3d85c6;">The people who still believe in man-made global warming are mostly on the radical fringe of society. This is why the most prominent advocates of global warming aren't scientists. They are murderers, tyrants, and madmen</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></blockquote></blockquote><div>As argumentation via guilt by (extreme) association goes, I would place this in the "WTF" category.&nbsp;Still, if this is the way Heartland want to play the game, I have some suggestions for future campaigns:</div><div><br /></div><div>- "CHARLES MANSON BELIEVED IN THIS SO-CALLED THEORY OF EVOLUTION. AND HE WAS A MURDUUUUUUURERRRR." [Note: This argument has already been <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/kingdomofpriests/2009/08/charles-manson-evolutionist.html" target="_blank">made</a>.]</div><div><br /></div><div>- "POL POT ALSO LIKE THIS 'GRAVITY' IDEA. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU USE THOSE FANCY NEWTONIAN MECHANICS."</div><div><br /></div><div>- "KARL MARX THOUGHT THAT BABIES CAME FROM A MAN'S PEE-PEE. ARE <i>YOU</i> A FREEDOM-HATING COMMIE? (www.heartlandforstorks.org)"</div><div><br /></div><div>- etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the record, I've double checked that the campaign and associated evidence were sourced from Heartland's official website and Twitter feed. Barring some extraordinary hack, I think that we're on safe ground in saying that this is legit.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, Bob (Murphy), if you happen to be reading this, I guess <a href="http://www.masterresource.org/2012/03/climate-alarmism-lessons-gleik/" target="_blank">my question</a> to you is: Does this&nbsp;"<span>reveal that these people really have no idea how their opponents on the climate issue actually view the world?</span>"</div>
