(Thanks guys!)</div><div><br /></div>The good news then, is that I recently joined <a href="http://noondaytune.com/" target="_blank">Noonday Tune</a> as a contributor. As the name suggests, this is a very cool website that posts a new song everyday at noon.<div><br /></div><div>My first three contributions are a mix of stuff that I've been listening to lately and then some Scandinavian bands that I feel deserve a wider international exposure:</div><div><ol><li>"<a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/43882091205" target="_blank">Augustine</a>" - <i>We Are Augustines</i></li><li>"<a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/45014106118" target="_blank">Hjerteknuser</a>" (Heartbreaker) - <i>Kaizers Orchestra</i></li><li>"<a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/46149412348" target="_blank">Sister to all</a>" - <i>Real Ones</i></li></ol></div><div>Well, don't just sit there.
