The Rugby World Cup 2011 starts tomorrow... BOOM!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.espnscrum.com/PICTURES/CMS/00/10.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Good times... GOOD times.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Will South Africa become the first team in the tournament's history to successfully defend the title? Is 2011 a few years too early for Australia's team of gifted youngsters?&nbsp;Can <i>this</i> New Zealand side finally put a 24-year hoodoo to rest on home soil? Most importantly, will Stickman's cable subscription hold out and provide the coverage he <strike>deserves</strike>&nbsp;needs to stay in touch with all the key games... despite his residing in a far-off land where the primitive locals are ignorant of the&nbsp;intricacies&nbsp;of the scrum, the savage beauty of the crash tackle, the deft touches required to put the inside man into space...&nbsp;and where combining the words "hooker" and "prop" in a sentence is likely to only invite accusations of sexual depravity? (Uncivilised boors!)<br /><br />My tentative answers to the above questions are: 1) "I fear not"; 2) "probably"; 3) "well, they won't be staying on home soil otherwise";... and 4) "by God, I hope so!".[*]<br /><br />Really, all other sports are just for laughs. This is what I'm talking about:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3K-UKp9dDFM" width="420"></iframe><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"></span><br /><a name='more'></a>[*] Actually, on question four, I've found a nice Irish pub down the road &mdash; there's one in every city! &mdash; that screens all the rugby games for desperate expats like me. It won't be quite the same vibes as the last World Cup, when I actually travelled to (then hosts) France to watch some games... but we'll have to make do!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-ash1/v172/95/31/577114114/n577114114_445759_2497.jpg?dl=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Last time around.<br /><i>Onbeskof</i>.</td></tr></tbody></table>
