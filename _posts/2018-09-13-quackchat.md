The University of Oregon runs a bi-monthly series of pub talks, or "[QuackChats](https://www.uoregon.edu/quackchats){:target="_blank"}" (geddit?), where professors get to engage the public on their research.

I gave such a talk on Tuesday, covering my research on "Big Data and Its Impact on Global Fisheries". Given the informal setting, I tried to keep it somewhat irreverent and, I hope, entertaining. (The beers helped.) Thanks to everyone who came out!
