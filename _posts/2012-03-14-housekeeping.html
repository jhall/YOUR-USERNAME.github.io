Some of you may have noticed that I've changed the previous post &mdash; on&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-03-11-real-reason-to-be-wary-of-kony-2012 %}" target="_blank">Invisible Children and James Inhofe</a> &mdash; around a bit since it was first published. I wrote it up in quite a rush and, looking over it today, realised that my motivations were perhaps a bit cryptic. Hopefully it reads a bit better now.<br /><br />Revisiting and tweaking old posts on this blog is an occasional habit of mine. I've never tried to change the fundamental meaning of any posts, or cover my tracks if someone calls me out in the comments. Rather, it's usually that I read something and think "<i>Who wrote this terrible mess? Do they even speak English?</i>" So, blame OCD, but I inevitably tend to think that I can improve my writing after it's already out there for the world to see.<br /><br />This is frustrating because I'm a terribly slow blogger as it is, and coursework leaves very little time for anything else. I don't know how other people doing graduate studies manage to keep up regular blogging activity with the workload. I suspect that the answer will reflect unfavourably on my mental faculties, so probably best not dwell on that issue...
