<div style="text-align: justify;">Exams all done and dusted :)</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Went reasonably well. Some time issues for two of them, but that's nothing uncommon for me to be honest...</div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, just a quick update as I'm currently in England for a 10 day holiday visiting F&amp;Fs before heading down south for the summer. I thought I might have left the cold behind in the Nordics, but fook me it's chilly over here. Seriously, "this" [-] cold. Snow everywhere and apparently all the airports have been shut. Luckily still have a few days before we're scheduled to &nbsp;fly back... </div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Hampshire right now with my aunt and uncle, but going up to Cambridge tomorrow to "partner" a friend for his College's Christmas Dinner. Got a couple mates studying there at the moment that I'm keen to catch up with and should be a good night. I also can't wait to <s>try on my heels</s> show off my 'tache. (Yes, I eventually <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EY7lYRneHc">ha-ha-hardened the hell up</a> and partook in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-10-31-movember %}">Movember</a>. We actually got a nice little group at school so I wasn't stuck on a Han Solo mission this time... Anyway, I ended up grooming a real steamer. Think <a href="http://aficionado.co.za/makethman/2010/08/12/mustache-man-1-errol-flynn/">Errol Flynn</a> or <a href="http://flashyourstache.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/zorro.gif">Zorro</a>.)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>En garde!</i></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">After Cambridge, I'm back to London to meet up with some other friends. Not too many of my old crew left standing after the great financial cull, but I have some great memories of my time in the city. Much of which was associated with music; for instance this one:</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KHkzH_ezgYw" width="420"></iframe><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i><br /><i>A little cheesy (read: obvious), I'll freely admit. Still. I personally think this Radio 1 'Live Lounge' version of "Fans" blows the album version out the water.</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On the subject of Kings of Leon... WTF was happening with their new album? Perhaps it requires more time, but I thought it was pretty much rubbish upon first listen. Or, as friend told me he saw tweeted the other day:&nbsp;</div><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">"KOL - grow back your beards and divorce your last two albums. You're stealing fans from 30 seconds to mars"&nbsp;</span></blockquote>The painful truth...
