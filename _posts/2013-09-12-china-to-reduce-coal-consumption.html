I've tried to emphasise the importance of <i>relative </i>concepts many times on this blog. However, there are occasions when relative measures can also be more than a little misleading. Case in point:&nbsp;<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/12/china-coal-pollution-idUKL3N0H80HB20130912">This article</a> from Reuters, which describes how China plans to reduce its coal consumption to 65% of primary energy by 2017.<br /><br />This policy prescription is primarily motivated by desire to improve the country's terrible air pollution. Of course, a reduction in coal will also bring climate benefits. (I have previously talked about the "co-benefits" of climate policy and local air pollution measures <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-03-19-climate-mitigation-as-secondary-benefit %}">here</a>.)<br /><br />However, despite being a tentative step in a right direction, this is hardly a watershed moment. In fact, the US Energy Information Agency (EIA) was already forecasting a drop in Chinese coal consumption to 65% of total energy by 2017 (from 69% in 2012) in the reference scenario of its <i><a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm">International Energy Outlook</a></i>, which was published earlier this year.<br /><br />More importantly, this relative decrease glosses over the fact that the&nbsp;absolute consumption of coal is forecast to <i>increase </i>by nearly 20% over the same period... Up from 79.2 quadrillion Btu in 2012 to an eye-watering 94.1 quad Btu in 2017!<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fs06R9-GQO0/UjGnlivq5rI/AAAAAAAAAWY/It8O6Eu2Kpw/s1600/Coal_consumption-Non-OECD-Non-OECD_Asia-China-Reference_case.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fs06R9-GQO0/UjGnlivq5rI/AAAAAAAAAWY/It8O6Eu2Kpw/s640/Coal_consumption-Non-OECD-Non-OECD_Asia-China-Reference_case.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/aeo/tablebrowser/#release=IEO2013&amp;subject=7-IEO2013&amp;table=7-IEO2013&amp;region=0-0&amp;cases=Reference-d041117" target="_blank">EIA data tool</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><b>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:</b> Be wary of anyone who tells you that China is leading the race in de-carbonising their economy, or winning the battle on renewables for that matter. The bigger picture is far more sobering.
