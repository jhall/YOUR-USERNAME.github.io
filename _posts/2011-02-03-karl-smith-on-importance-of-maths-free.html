<div style="text-align: justify;">... And simple&nbsp;allegorical stories to help our intuitive understanding of economic concepts. Here is an <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/02/02/what-kind-of-papers-should-we-celebrate-math-free-essays-and-the-baby-sitting-economy/">excerpt</a>:</div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I posted a link to Bryan Caplan’s paper on&nbsp;<a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/02/01/behavioral-economics-and-the-welfare-state" style="border-bottom-color: rgb(207, 226, 229); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px;">Behavioral Economics and the Welfare State</a>. Many of the comments I got from economists were predictable:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Where is the formal model and existence proofs?</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Where is the data analysis?</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. How is this a paper?</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Do you mean to tell me this is publishable?&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I too was shocked initially by these features or lack thereof. However, that’s part of what made the paper compelling.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Some papers get a wonderful data set, perform magnificent identification and get a result that really changes your mind about something you care about. Most don’t.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Most are cases that are of very narrow interest or do a 90% good job at the ID but leave enough doors open that you are not really sure if&nbsp; the result is meaningful or not.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">On the other hand, one could as Bryan and his co-author did, attack an important question, string together some non-obvious points and in my case leave the reader thinking about whether he or she should reexamine an import view.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">The profession should rightly celebrate the first kind of paper.&nbsp;However, what about the relative worth of the second and the third?</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I submit that bringing up arguments that use the economic way of thinking matter. This is true even if the argument is not definitive, has no mathematical proof behind it and marshals no data.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">Now, clearly I've written in support of using maths in economics on this blog <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-10-02-why-we-need-maths-in-economics %}">before</a>. However, in case anyone missed it, my point was <i>not </i>to say that we have to have put forward a mathematical equation for each and every economic argument or study.&nbsp;Indeed, I took some pains to make it explicit that this wasn't the case... Shoehorning a maths proof into an economics paper does not (cannot) constitute analytical rigour, let alone intellectual honesty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I wholeheartedly agree with the excerpt above. We should embrace any economic paper and/or argument that aids our conceptual understanding, or forces us to&nbsp;re-examine&nbsp;our views on a particular subject. However, I continue to submit that theory alone is insufficient...&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Smith goes on to describe the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/1937/">baby-sitting coop</a>&nbsp;allegory, which he says did more to make him a "confident Keynesian" than any other analysis. The important caveat here is that - <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/02/02/what-kind-of-papers-should-we-celebrate-math-free-essays-and-the-baby-sitting-economy/#comment-10212">as pointed out in the comments section</a> - we have competing&nbsp;parables such as Bastiat's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">Broken Window</a>" that appear to offer completely different policy&nbsp;prescriptions. Again, this reinforces my belief that we ultimately need to seek empirical validation/refutation of our theories, whether they come in the form of a complex mathematical proof or a simple children's story. As I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-11-05-physics-envy-again %}">here</a>:</div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #444444;">Knowing when to use your tools is just as important as knowing how to use them. Also, the ultimate test for any model - mathematical or otherwise - should always be how well it describes real-life data.</span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY</b>: It's always good to have a explanation at hand that everyone can understand.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">PS - The Bryan Caplan <a href="http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/perfinal.doc">paper</a> that Smith is making reference to here is well worth a read. There are also some interesting critiques in the <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/02/01/behavioral-economics-and-the-welfare-state/#comments">comments section</a> of Smith's&nbsp;initial&nbsp;post about it.</div>
