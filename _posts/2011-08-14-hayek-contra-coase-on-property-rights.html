Say it ain't so!<br /><br />Well... I guess it ain't <i>technically </i>"so"... but hear me out on this one.<br /><br /><a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/do-property-rights-increase-freedom.html">Noah Smith</a>, citing his personal experiences in Japan, writes that <i>irreducible transaction costs</i> place a not insignificant constraint on the gains to be had through privatisation:<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">[T]he existence of a government-owned "commons" often makes people feel more free, not less. Sure, the commons is financed through taxation, and sure, that means that people generally don't receive benefits exactly equal to what they pay. But the difference can be small, and is often canceled out by the fact that you only pay once rather than a million billion times. [...]Past a certain point, the gains to privatization are outweighed by the sheer weight of transaction cost externalities. (Note that transaction costs also kill the </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #4c1130;">Coase Theorem</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span">, another libertarian standby; this is no coincidence.)</span></blockquote>Of course, these aren't new points... Even yours truly has been known to say similar such things. From time to time. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-02-14-our-climate-isnt-only-green-concern %}">Ahem</a>.<br /><br />All that being said, the above is really just an elaborate segue to something else that I read earlier this week: A 1995 paper by the late Paul Samuelson,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cui-zy.cn/Recommended/Yalelaw/CoaseSamuelson.pdf"><i><b>Some uneasiness with the Coase Theorem</b></i></a>.<br /><br />In typically pithy fashion, Samuelson hits on several issues surrounding the Coase Theorem that have come up in the blogosphere. Such as:<br />- What exactly qualifies this as an original "theorem"?:&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span">Many   disciples cheerfully  agree:   There   is no   Coase   Theorem.</span>&nbsp;(Cf. <a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2006/01/what_is_the_coa.html">Env-Econ</a>.)<br />- The problem of distorted incentives&nbsp;in establishing an efficient allocation of resources: "<span class="Apple-style-span">If   I  go   the   road   of  buying   off  those who   would burglarize   me,   I  soon   evoke   a  new   supply   of  threatening   burglars.</span>"&nbsp;(Cf.&nbsp;<a href="http://mattrognlie.com/2011/05/04/understanding-the-coase-theorem/">Matt Rognlie</a>.)<br /><br />His biggest concerns, however, are reserved for the Coaseian tendency to collapse &mdash; and then conveniently file away &mdash; important strategic considerations under the umbrella of (zero) transaction costs. Of course, information&nbsp;asymmetries&nbsp;between bargaining parties&nbsp;are an intrinsic characteristic of unequal property rights distribution, thus severely inhibiting the possibly of achieving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto optimal</a> outcomes.[*] More fundamentally, though, Samuelson argues that bilateral bargaining agreements such as Coase envisaged between, say, a land owner and free-roaming ranchers,&nbsp;suffer from the same inherent inefficiencies as standard duopolies / bilateral monopolies. That is, they are beset by various (game-theoretic) strategic considerations that undermine the negotiating process:<br /><br />What really interested me amidst all of this was Samuelson's invocation of Hayek to highlight the crux of his argument.&nbsp;Here's some of the meat:<br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">The Coase-Samuelson generation were brought up witnessing the great&nbsp;debate between von Mises and Lerner-Lange concerning the feasibility of&nbsp;socialist rational pricing to produce Utopia. (That was a reprise of earlier&nbsp;Pareto-Barone-Wieser-Taylor debates.) Many contemporaries believed Lerner-Lange triumphed in the debate. I came to believe that Friedrich Hayek was the true victor.</span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span">Under static conditions where all is known or knowable (to whom?), whatever optimal states laissez-faire might occasion, so could some computer&nbsp;solution or some algorithms of play the game of competition also achieve.&nbsp;But in the real world all is changing, even in the time it takes me to write this&nbsp;sentence. Hayek has been persuasive &mdash; not in Whig ideology or in declaring that moderate reform of laissez-faire leads inevitably down the road to totalitarian socialism but &mdash; in arguing that experience suggests that only with heavy dependence on &nbsp;market pricing mechanisms can there be realized quasi-efficient and quasi-progressive organization of societies involving humans as Darwinian history has bequeathed them[...]<br /><br />My point is that the same thing applies to legal assignment of property rights. [...]We can contrive [in public utility economics] a variety of alternative property rights that would make for Pareto-Optimality. [...]But  in  the   time   it  takes   me   to  write   this   paragraph,   exogenous  change and   dynamic   endogenous   change   will cause   the   data   of   the   problem   to change in   such   a  way   as   to   entail   a  different   set   of   property   rights.   If   the Social   Contract   makes   all earlier   property   rights   capable   of  being   abrogated to   adjust   to new   Pareto-Optimal   needs,   we   are   in  the   old   quagmire   of  moral hazard,   inverse externalities,   and   so   forth.   No doubt   wise Twenty-First-Century   Hayeks   or   Lerners  will  come   forward   to   give  persuasive   counsel   on   how a Mixed   Economy   will  want   to   compromise   among   divergent instrumentalities   so   as   to   optimize   various   definitions   of social   and   individual   welfares.</span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;[snip]</span><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span">To try to  capture  all that which  contributes to  deadweight loss  under   the  verbal  rubric  of  "transactions  costs" weakens  a  useful concept without  gaining  understanding  of  incompleteness  of  markets,  asymmetries  of&nbsp;information,  and  insusceptibilities  of   various  technologies  to  decentralized  pricing&nbsp;algorithms.</span></blockquote>Anyway, read <a href="http://www.cui-zy.cn/Recommended/Yalelaw/CoaseSamuelson.pdf">the article</a>&nbsp;to get a better understanding of the context. It's only six pages long and cuts to the core of some of the persistent scepticism surrounding the Coase Theorem. (Not that Ronald Coase himself wasn't aware of the practical limitations of his approach, as I have tried to explain&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-04-11-links-market-design-edition %}">previously</a>.) And, when you're done with that, you can read a comment on Samuelson's article &mdash; in partial defence of Coase &mdash; by another esteemed economist, Oliver Willamson, <a href="http://bbs.cenet.org.cn/UploadImages/200582519335615039.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE</b>: Continuing with my famous economist links fest, Deirdre McCloskey weighs in loquaciously on the matter <a href="http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/pdf/Article_306.pdf">here</a>.<br />___<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] Recall that the original formulation of Coase's argument held that zero transaction costs effectively meant perfect information among all parties.</span>
