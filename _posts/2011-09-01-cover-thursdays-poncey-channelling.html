<i>Guest post.</i><br /><br /><i>My mate, Poncey notes my calls for help RE this whole blogging thing and a lack of sufficient posting time. I would also let the record state that the man has started up <a href="http://primalbeer.wordpress.com/">his own blog</a>, which you'll no-doubt be wanting visit straight after reading this! Who can resist a "</i><span class="Apple-style-span">A Smörgåsbord of weighty opinions[...] An exotic blend of rants, sport, music and observations of the absurd in everyday life &mdash; as well as some other kak.</span><i>"? Not I. Anyway, here the Ponceman making a fairly ballsy call - Ed.</i><br /><br />Right, so you get really excited when you hear that one of your favourite bands is singing a cover of one of your favourite artists. &nbsp;In this case it's the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078qT-413PA">Decemberists* doing Leonard Cohen's 'Hey that's no way to say goodbye'</a>. &nbsp;You patiently wait for it to be released and for it to reach YouTube and when &mdash; and I'm just finishing my first listen here as I type &mdash; you hear it and you're thoroughly disappointed.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I was going to say something along the lines of you've got to have a huge set of stones to cover Leonard Cohen, but then I realised that an oke named Rufus Wainwright and Liv Tyler have done decent efforts &mdash; so maybe he lends himself to the cover a bit better than Bobby D.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you're reading Stickman's blog or know the man personally you're probably not averse to the odd thesis-length post or conversation (he remains the only person I've ever heard use annotations during a conversation), but I'm going to keep this relatively short.</div><div><br /></div><div>Covering Dylan is an insane risk in my opinion. &nbsp;Yes, Guns 'n Roses, Jimi Hendrix and no doubt some quite enjoy the wailing of Joan Baez or the unbearable naff-ness that is the Byrds. &nbsp;Yes yes. &nbsp;Making something that is already brilliant more popular ain't really the point.</div><div><br /></div><div>HOWEVER, I do believe I have found the greatest Dylan cover ever. &nbsp;Up until two months ago it wasn't on YouTube, but here it is now for your enjoyment.</div><div><br /></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fAqhYywgVTk" width="420"></iframe></div><div><br /></div><div>Aim your stones at the body. &nbsp;Go.</div><div><br /></div><div>Poncey.&nbsp;</div>
