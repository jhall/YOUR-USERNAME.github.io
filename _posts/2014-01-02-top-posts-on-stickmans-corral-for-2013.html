As if you care!<br /><br />I'll limit it to three because: a) Parsimony, b) Blogger is being recalcitrant b*tch at the moment and is not letting me see any more than that.<br /><br />1) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-06-03-econ-blogosphere-comment-form %}" target="_blank"><b>Econ blogosphere comment form</b></a>. Way out in front &mdash; with nearly 7,000 views thanks to links from FT Alpha, Barry Ritholtz and a bunch of people on Twitter &mdash; was this spoof of the various personalities, trolls and anti-trolls that populate today's economic blogs. Some of the additional suggestions provided by commentators were golden.<br /><br />2) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-01-27-thinking-of-doing-phd %}" target="_blank"><b>Thinking of doing a PhD?</b></a> My post advocating for postgraduate studies in Norway accumulated around a 1,000 views over the course of the year. It would appear that the idea of drawing a healthy salary whilst having access to great data and clean air could prove a viable alternative to crushing student debt (or miserly graduate stipends) and 80-hour work weeks. As an aside: A fairly large number of hits on this one where referrals from a single comment that I left under one of <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/if-you-get-phd-get-economics-phd.html" target="_blank">Noah Smith's blog posts</a>. Thus is the way of the blogosphere layer cake.<br /><br />3) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-01-20-review-extreme-environment-ivo-vegter %}" target="_blank"><b>Review - Extreme Environment (Ivo Vegter)</b>.</a>&nbsp;It may not have reached the top spot, but my review of Ivo Vegter's anti-environmentalism screed was certainly the longest post of the year. Five thousand words for around <strike>750</strike> 1,000 views may sound like a poor return to some, but it does occupy second place in the Google search rankings for Vegter's book behind only Amazon. Speaking of which: Rather irritatingly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKHTNRQMFZ16/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1KKHTNRQMFZ16" target="_blank">my abridged review on Amazon</a> has garnered more "unhelpful" votes than the other way around. I emphasise the "helpful" bit. This isn't about whether you agree with an author &mdash; or reviewer for that matter &mdash; but rather a question of whether a review enables you to obtain a better understanding of a book and it's relative merits. I guess in-depth, considered criticism is less helpful than gushing, one-line endorsements. (Or lazy dismissals for that matter.) Haters gonna hate. Derpers gonna derp.<br /><br />If memory serves me correctly, I have a couple posts with 500-odd views here at Stickman's... while my most widely read articles of the year were almost certainly <a href="http://theenergycollective.com/posts/published/user/383836" target="_blank">the series</a> I did for the <i>Energy Collective</i> on natural gas. So, it's been a respectable year blogging-wise for yours truly. I might get around to listing my personal favourite posts of the year later during the week.
