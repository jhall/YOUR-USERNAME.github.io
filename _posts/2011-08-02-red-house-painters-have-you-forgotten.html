Talking about the <i>Vanilla Sky</i> soundtrack, here's a great example of a "nearly perfect" song. I'm not sure where the problem lies exactly, but it's just missing that extra something that would make it one for the ages.&nbsp;(My instincts tell me it's the chorus and some sloppy lyrics in the middle...) Still, well worth a listen:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/91j8k1MApLU" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />NOTE: Yes, I realise that these clips are not from&nbsp;<i>Vanilla&nbsp;Sky</i>. They're from&nbsp;<i>Ã€ la folie... pas du tout&nbsp;</i>(He loves me... he loves me not). However, it was about the only video that I could find on YouTube that had the correct version of the song, which didn't involve tortured little emo sayings flashing across the screen.
