<div style="text-align: justify;">Having discussed some similar implications for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-10-29-south-africa-planning-worlds-biggest %}">grandiose solar plans</a> in South Africa, here's a snippet from an interview with <a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/">Bright Source Energy</a> CEO, John Woolard. Talking to <i><a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/in_californias_mojave_desert_solar_thermal_projects_take_off/2334/">Yale Environment 360</a></i>, he discusses the company's experiences from building solar-thermal plants in California's parched Mojave Desert:</div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span">e360:</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;BrightSource’s Ivanpah project is not only the first large-scale solar thermal project to break ground, it is the first to deploy a new power tower technology. Why is that significant?</span></blockquote><div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span">Woolard:</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;[snip]&nbsp;The big [problem] is water. What is the world going to look like over the next 20, 30, 40 years? Water in the desert is going to become a much more challenging proposition. So we’ve gotten water usage down to a minimum — the lowest of anybody in the world, basically.</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">[snip]</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span">e360:</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span">&nbsp;It seems that one thing BrightSource did that avoided a lot of controversy was the water issue. You chose to use “dry” cooling, which uses substantially less water than “wet” cooling.</span>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><b>Woolard:</b> Best decision we ever made as a company. We were the only one that did it early. The fact that we’re doing it has forced others to do it. If you use 2,000 or 3,000 acre-feet of water [the equivalent of nearly 1 billion gallons] in the desert on an annual basis, that’s obscene.&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">We’re providing power for 150,000 homes, and we’re using water for 300 homes. That’s as water-efficient as anything you can do. Fossil plants still use wet cooling and everybody ought to know that. That needs to change. It ought to be a level playing field. It shouldn’t just be renewables that do this. Energy and water are so inextricably linked.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><a name='more'></a><div style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, the <i>150,000 homes vs 300 homes</i> stat is a tremendously impressive trade-off for anyone concerned about water scarcity.&nbsp;<s>I'm too lazy to look it up now</s> I can't comment with absolute certainty, but I'm pretty sure these plants will be tapping groundwater for their water needs. Further, I guess Woolard's claim about&nbsp;about other companies being forced to adopt dry cooling is down to direct quantity regulation than any market mechanism... I wonder how their cost figures are lining up?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For the record, according to the <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf">US Department of Energy</a>:</div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #073763;">Analyses indicate that the use of either direct or indirect dry cooling can eliminate over 90% of the water consumed in a water-cooled concentrating solar power plant. However, a combination of a reduction in power output and the added cost of the air cooling equipment is estimated to add roughly 2 to 10% to the cost of generating electricity, depending on the plant location and other assumptions</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">. </span><i>[Editors Note: From what I've read elsewhere, I think the figure ought generally to be closer to 10% than 2%...]</i></blockquote><b>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY</b>: Using less water can increase costs, but not as much as running out of water.<br /><br /><i>Thanks JM</i></div>
