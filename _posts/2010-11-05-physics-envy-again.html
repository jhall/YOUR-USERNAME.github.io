<div style="text-align: justify;">Seeing as I've <a href="http://stickmanscorral.blogspot.com/search/label/Maths">covered</a> the topic a few times already, here is an interesting - and&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;amusing - presentation by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/">Andrew Lo</a> of MIT, based on a paper he has co-authored with (physicist) Mark T. Mueller: "<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1003/1003.2688v3.pdf">WARNING: Physics Envy May be Hazardous To Your Wealth!</a>"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lo's discussion is somewhat contextualised towards financial economics and markets, but he certainly builds his case by first discussing economics in general:</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><object align="middle" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,0,0" height="361" id="Main" width="481"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://mitworld.mit.edu/flash/player/Main.swf?host=cp58255.edgefcs.net&flv=mitw-01283-sloan-bttc-10-econ-physics-lo-05jun2010&preview=http://mitworld.mit.edu//uploads/mitwstill01283sloanbttc10econphysicslo05jun2010.jpg" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /><embed src="http://mitworld.mit.edu/flash/player/Main.swf?host=cp58255.edgefcs.net&flv=mitw-01283-sloan-bttc-10-econ-physics-lo-05jun2010&preview=http://mitworld.mit.edu//uploads/mitwstill01283sloanbttc10econphysicslo05jun2010.jpg" quality="high" bgcolor="#000000" width="481" height="361" name="Main" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></object></div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">(HT: <a href="http://aidwatchers.com/2010/10/physics-envy-in-development-even-worse-than-in-finance/#comments">Bill Easterly</a>. The actual presentation begins around the 03:10 mark)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">As I see it, Lo and Mueller's general propositions dovetail nicely with the arguments that I (and many others for that matter) have <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-10-02-why-we-need-maths-in-economics %}">put forward</a> in the past. For instance (+/-07:05), focusing on&nbsp;<i>when&nbsp;</i>to use your tools rather than simply throwing them to one side:</div></div><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span">So what we thought we would do in this paper is to try to trace the origins of&nbsp;physics&nbsp;envy and then see whether or not it really is the cause of crisis, or when it is and when it isn't, and how we might deal with it in a somewhat more productive manner than simply saying that quant is broken and we should forget all about all of this fancy mathematics.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote style="text-align: justify;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Because, frankly, when I first came across this very popular sentiment that quant is at the root of financial evils, I have to say that it struck me a little bit odd. It's a bit like blaming&nbsp;arithmetic&nbsp;and the real number system for accounting fraud. It's true that they're involved, but you're sort of missing a piece!</span></div></blockquote>Among the many interesting points Lo makes, it's also intriguing to see how&nbsp;reverent&nbsp;he is to&nbsp;the supposed father of physics envy,&nbsp;Paul Samuelson. For example, at (+/-) 12:45 he defends Samuelson against a charge of blind physics envy by quoting a passage from the latter's famous&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Economic_Analysis">dissertation</a>:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span">[O]nly the smallest fraction of economic writings, theoretical and applied, has&nbsp;been concerned with the derivation of <i>operationally meaningful</i> theorems. In part&nbsp;at least this has been the result of the bad methodological preconceptions that&nbsp;economic laws deduced from <i>a priori</i> assumptions possessed rigor and validity&nbsp;independently of any empirical human behavior. But only a very few economists&nbsp;have gone so far as this. The majority would have been glad to enunciate meaningful&nbsp;theorems if any had occurred to them. In fact, the literature abounds with&nbsp;false generalization.&nbsp;</span>(Samuelson, 1947, p. 3)&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>[Editors note: Samuelson goes on to add (p. 4): </i><span class="Apple-style-span"><i>"By a </i>meaningful theorem<i> I simply mean a hypothesis about empirical data which could conceivably be refuted, if only under ideal conditions."</i></span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability" style="font-style: italic;">Karl Popper</a><i> anyone?&nbsp;I would also note that Lo makes repeated reference to the need for empirical testing as a means of validating economic theory, at the same time as he is wide-eyed about the problems we may encounter in doing so.]</i></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><a name='more'></a><div style="text-align: justify;">Moving back to main thrust of the presentation and paper, Lo and Mueller&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty">follow</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Knight.html">Frank H. Knight</a>&nbsp;in focusing on the distinction between two types of randomness: <i>risk </i>and <i>uncertainty</i>. The former - "risk" - refers to the type of randomness that lends itself to prediction, while the latter - "uncertainty" - is everything else.&nbsp;(You can skip to 14:10 if you want to see a nice illustration of this distinction via the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox">Ellsberg's Paradox</a> and our behavioural reaction to it.) Lo and Mueller develop this concept of Knightian Uncertainty further by proposing a more refined taxonomy:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Complete Certainty</b> <i>(e.g. Newton's three laws... for certain frames of reference)</i></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Risk Without Certainty</b> <i>(Known probability distributions)</i></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fully Reducible Uncertainty</b> <i>(You can get close to Level 2 by testing a model with sufficient sample size that produce known/observable outcomes)&nbsp;</i></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Partially Reducible Uncertainty</b> <i>(There will always be some level of unknowable randomness that you can't transform into quantifiable risk. Bayesian methods are likely to be more appropriate...)</i></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Irreducible Uncertainty</b> <i>(The realm of religion and astrology... E.g. "What is the meaning of life?")</i></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The problem comes in when investors (and social scientists) mistake the level of the&nbsp;continuum that they are &nbsp;operating in.&nbsp;While we may find ourselves in, say, Level 3... often we are closer to Level 4. Being overconfident about our level of certainty is, in effect, what characterises physics envy.&nbsp;Lo and Mueller conclude by offering a framework to best determine when quantitative analysis and mathematical modelling will be most useful to resolving an economic problem.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;"><b>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY</b>: Knowing when to use your tools is just as important as knowing how to use them. Also, the ultimate test for any model - mathematical or otherwise - should always be how well it describes real-life data.<br /><br />PS - The issue of uncertainty is the source of some of the most interesting work that's being done in the field of climate change economics. I hope to write a brief introduction for the layman sometime in the future, but take a look <a href="http://idei.fr/doc/by/gollier/discounting_long_term.pdf">here </a>and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/ReactionsCritique.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;if you feel inspired.</div></div>
