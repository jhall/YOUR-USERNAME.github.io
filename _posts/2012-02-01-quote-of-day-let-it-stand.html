This one comes via my friend and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-12-31-new-years-resolutions-and-literary %}" target="_blank">rival <i>literatus</i></i></a>, Bloomsboy[*]. It concerns James Joyce's relationship with protégé&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Waiting for Godot</i> playwright, Samuel Beckett, at the time when the latter's failing eyesight had left him dictating his words to others:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>Once or twice [Joyce] dictated a bit of Finnegans Wake to Beckett, though dictation did not work very well for him; in the middle of one such session there was a knock at the door which Beckett didn't hear. Joyce said, `Come in,' and Beckett wrote it down. Afterwards he read back what he had written and Joyce said, `What's that "Come in"?' 'Yes, you said that,' said Beckett. Joyce thought for a moment, then said, `Let it stand.' He was quite willing to accept coincidence as his collaborator.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">Richard Ellmann, James Joyce (New York, 1959), pp. 661-662.</div><br />A beautiful sentiment that, coincidentally, goes some way towards explaining the incomprehensibility of Finnegans Wake.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">---</div><span style="font-size: x-small;">[*] Self-styled in a moment of apparent irony.</span><br />
