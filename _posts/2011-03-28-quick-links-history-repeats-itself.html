Some things that I've been meaning to write about, but short on time[*]...<br /><br />1) <b>A heavily fancied <a href="http://www.isport.in/cricket-world-cup/south-africa-v-new-zealand-proteas-choke-again-snatch-defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory-2355/itemid-329">South Africa bombs out during the knock-out stages of the Cricket World Cup</a></b>. As I wrote on facebook: "Wait. I've seen this movie before." Or, in the endearing words of Yogi Berra: "<span class="Apple-style-span">It's <i>déjà vu</i> all over again!</span>" (In related news, the ever reliable <a href="http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/289664-110327st">Zapiro</a> brokes little sympathy for the apologists.)<br /><br />2) Speaking of&nbsp;<i>déjà&nbsp;vu</i>...&nbsp;<b>South Africa's favourite electricity monopoly,&nbsp;<s>Eishkom</s> Eskom, has covered itself in glory yet again</b>. This time, serving up "a&nbsp;comedy of errors" that ultimately resulted in a <a href="http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Eskom-makes-R3bn-boo-boo-20110327">massive explosion at a key power plant</a>. The end result: Expenses of R3bn ($440m) for the company - thanks tax payer! - and a "severely compromised" national electricity supply. Seriously, is there anyone left who believes that we can delay the move to a competitive power market any longer?<br /><br />3) More promising news is that <b>South Africa is finally set to <a href="http://www.2oceansvibe.com/2011/03/22/water-soon-to-be-subjected-to-eskom-ish-tariff-hikes-too/">hike water rates in a bid to secure desperately needed investment for ageing infrastructure</a></b>. A.F.T, as far as I am concerned. If you don't charge people rates&nbsp;commensurable&nbsp;to the cost of supplying water, <a href="http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Dirty-water-for-many-parts-of-SA-20110327">sooner or later</a> you won't be able to supply anyone at all. Or, as I commented: "<span class="Apple-style-span">To speak some 'economese', we need to charge water rates equivalent to the long-run marginal costs of providing it.</span>" You can see some of my (brief) previous thoughts on water pricing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-09-30-south-africa-facing-water-pollution %}">here</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-09-30-water-pricing-in-different-sectors %}">here</a>.<br /><br />4) I'm less optimistic about the <b>Chinese command-and-control approach to water management, as officials announced <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2011-03-28-china-unveils-new-energy-water-efficiency-goals/">plans to&nbsp;reduce water use<i> per unit of GDP</i> by 7%</a></b>. I share the sentiments of many in thinking that water will ultimately prove the defining barrier for China's continued growth explosion, which has thus far come at a very large environmental and health cost. That the government has pledged a 30% reduction in water consumption (per unit of GDP) over the next five years is a start. Like any good economist, however, I maintain that they'll have to get prices involved if they want to make real improvements in water conservation over the long-term.&nbsp;(Having said that, and while I much prefer the market mechanism, the Chinese have been successful in their stated aims of reducing energy intensity thus far... moderate as these may be in reality.)<br /><br />5) And now, for something completely different:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cV6I1_o6vrY" title="YouTube video player" width="425"></iframe><br /><br />Alan! Alan! Alan!... Al! Alan!<br /><br />I also enjoyed this:<br /><blockquote>"What was the answer?"<br />"Spatula. They're just making them up now."</blockquote><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">[*] That, coupled with the fact that I was somewhat overzealous at both the gym and (later) the bar over the weekend. I can still barely straighten my arms. Walking around like a hungover T-Rex.&nbsp;</span>
