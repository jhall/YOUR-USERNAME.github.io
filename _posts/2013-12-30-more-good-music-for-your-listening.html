It occurs to me that I haven't mentioned my Noondaytune contributions in ages. Without further ado and including some snippets from my rather lyrical write-ups:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/58410454453/pretty-saro-bob-dylan-while-us-mortals-are" target="_blank"><i>Pretty Saro</i> - Bob Dylan</a>. ("Dylan fans are going to be rejoicing in their master’s munificence… and his bountiful back catalogue.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/59761769290/been-there-before-ghost-beach-ghost-beach-are" target="_blank"><i>Been There Before</i> - Ghost Beach</a>.&nbsp;("... a nice reminder that sometimes music doesn’t need to be anything other than fun and instantly accessible.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/63160208140/but-we-did-thomas-dybdahl-thomas-dybdahl-is" target="_blank"><i>But We Did</i> - Thomas Dybdahl</a>.&nbsp;("You’ll find shades of Bon Iver here (with a less annoying falsetto) and maybe even a distant hint of Jeff Buckley.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/60529982872/indie-cindy-pixies-so-if-you-hadnt-heard" target="_blank"><i>Indie Cindy</i> - Pixies</a>.&nbsp;("Comparisons with their early work and sound is probably inevitable at this point. However...&nbsp;if there are any of those famous hard-soft dynamics at play in this song, then the order has been switched. The verses are now abrasive, while the choruses, instead of being explosive, are soothingly melodic.") </li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/61837482731/working-for-you-patrick-sweany-im-not-sure" target="_blank"><i>Working For You</i> - Patrick Sweany</a>.&nbsp;("... it feels like the world could do with a more generous helping of blues-infused rock. I’m doing what I can to remedy matters with this track.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/64466643929/girl-from-the-north-country-cover-secret" target="_blank"><i>Girl From The North Country</i> - Secret Machine</a>s.&nbsp;("This cover version manages to do that rare thing: Preserving the essence of a great song whilst reinventing its dynamics. Listening to it feels like being washed over by a storm and then left in the tranquil aftermath of its passing.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/65773720203/always-panama-i-had-something-else-in-mind-for" target="_blank"><i>Always</i> - Panama</a>. ("... this Sydney-based quartet is helping to erase any lingering Antipodean antipathy I bear as a result of various cricket World Cups.&nbsp;More importantly, if this is where pop music is going, count me in.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/66955706869/i-got-love-if-you-want-it-slim-harpo-born-into" target="_blank"><i>I Got Love If You Want It</i> - Slim Harpo</a>. ("Taking his stage name from the harmonica (or “harp”) that he played with such laconic precision, his songs were gratefully adapted by a veritable who’s who of 1960s rock ‘n roll.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/68550417951/california-mazzy-star-it-has-been-20-years" target="_blank"><i>California</i> - Mazzy Star</a>. ("It has been 20 years since “Fade Into You” first drifted through the speakers of my night-time radio like a somnambulist’s love song. With this reunion album, Mazzy Star have embarked upon a continuation that is eerily reminiscent... Perhaps a small testament to L.P. Hartley’s famous observation about the past being a different country: they do things differently there.")</li><li><a href="http://noondaytune.com/post/69963162932/nothing-to-lose-but-your-head-augustines-given" target="_blank"><i>Nothing To Lose But Your Head</i> - Augustines</a>. ("This latest single comes ahead of their eponymous sophomore album and exudes all the grit, verve and elation that made their last record such a <i>tour de force</i>.")</li></ul><div>If I had to pick three favourites from the above list, it would probably have to be Secret Machines, Panama and Augustines. Ask me tomorrow though and that might change. Regardless, the bottom line is that we[*] here at Stickman's Corral are constantly scouring the internet for good music so that you don't have to!</div><div><br /></div><div>[*] The royal "we".</div>
