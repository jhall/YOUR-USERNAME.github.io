You may have noticed that blogging activity around these parts has taken a marked turn for the worse lately. My life has turned into one soul-sapping assignment after another, with additional research commitments and course work... And I really need to&nbsp;start prepping for exams too.<br /><br />I feel a bit like this to be honest:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/711bZ_pLusQ" width="560"></iframe><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i>"Head for the sides, damn you stupid slinky!"</i></div><br />In all likelihood then, I won't be posting any new material on the site until finals are done.<strike> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes?qt=qt0464815" target="_blank">My only hope is that the big Lebowksi kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off</a></strike>.<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll emerge relatively unscathed and also be able to tell you more about some fairly cool developments happening this side.<br /><br />Until then, <i>adios</i> and stay classy.
